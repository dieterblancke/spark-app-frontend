# SparkAppFrontend

This project is a small demo as was requested by Spark.

## Setup
To set up this application, you will first and foremost need Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have done that, you can checkout this project and run the following command in the project directory:
```bash
npm install
```

After that, you can run the application by starting it's development server with the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

This should have started up the application and it should now be available at `http://localhost:4200/` (by default).
