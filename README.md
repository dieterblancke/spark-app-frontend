This project is a small demo as was requested by Spark.

To set up this application, you will first and foremost need both Git and Node.js installed on your machine:
- You can download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have done that, you can checkout this project by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dieterblancke/spark-app-frontend.git
```

Afterwards, to install the dependencies you'll want to run the following command in the project directory:
